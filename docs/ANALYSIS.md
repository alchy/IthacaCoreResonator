## Missing Principles — Priority Order

### 1. Phantom Partials (longitudinal waves)

**Cited by:** Chabassier/Chaigne/Joly 2013, RR-8181, RR-9516, SubM2AN, Simionato 2024 (×3 papers), Bank/Chabassier 2019, Piano-model-revis — **8 of 18 papers**

**Physics:** Geometric nonlinearity of the string couples transverse and longitudinal vibrations.
Longitudinal modes appear at `f_k^L ≈ 2·f_k` with `τ^L ≈ τ/2`.
Also cross-product combinations `f_i ± f_j` (stronger in bass/forte).

**Perceptual impact:** Characteristic "zing" of the attack, especially in bass notes (MIDI < 48) and at forte dynamics. Clearly audible in recordings, absent in current synthesis.

**Implementation path** (additive synth — no PDE needed):
1. In `extract_params.py`: detect longitudinal peaks at `2·f_k` in the spectrum; fit `A0_L`, `tau_L`.
2. Add to `PartialParams`: `float A0_long; float tau_long;` (or store as extra partial entries with a `is_longitudinal` flag).
3. In `resonator_voice.cpp`: render longitudinal partials as single-string (mono), no beating, `f = 2·f_k`.

### 2. Velocity-Dependent Spectral Shape

**Cited by:** HammerJSVV3 (Chabassier/Duruflé 2014), Piano-Chaigne-SMAC13 (Chaigne 2013), Teng 2012, Bank 2019 — **5 of 18 papers**

**Physics:** Hammer shank flexibility causes spectral differences of 10–25 dB around 600–1100 Hz between legato and staccato at equal loudness. Forte has spectral width ~7 kHz vs. ~5 kHz for piano.

**Current state:** `vel_gamma` scales amplitude only — forte is louder piano, not spectrally different.

**Implementation path:**
- `eq_gains_db[EQ_BANDS]` is already per-velocity-layer.
  Currently only `A0` is interpolated; interpolate `eq_gains_db` across velocity layers too.
- `extract_params.py` already computes EQ per layer — wire interpolation at `noteOn`.
- Cost: 8 floats interpolated at note-on, zero audio-path cost.

### 3. Soundboard Modal Transients

**Cited by:** Breve (Chabassier 2013), MAESSTRO, RR-8181, SubM2AN, Piano-model-revis — **5 of 18 papers**

**Physics:** The soundboard has ~2400 modal frequencies. At note-on, the bridge impulse excites these modes; they ring briefly (~50–200 ms), especially below 1 kHz. Current `BiquadEQ` approximates the steady-state spectrum but not the time-varying modal texture at attack.

**Perceptual impact:** Missing "body" at attack onset; low notes sound thin in the first 50–100 ms.

**Implementation path (approximate, RT-compatible):**
- Add 6–12 IIR bandpass resonators per voice, tuned to dominant soundboard modes (shared across notes, constant per instrument).
- Excited by a brief impulse at `noteOn`, decay independently with τ ≈ 50–300 ms.
- Parameters could be globally fixed (not per-note) or extracted from low-frequency EQ residuals.

### 4. Physical Hammer Model

**Cited by:** HammerJSVV3, ChabassierChaigneJoly, RR-8181, SubM2AN — **4 of 18 papers**

**Physics:** Hertz nonlinear contact force `F = K·(x_H - x_S)^p` (p ≈ 2.5–3.5). Hammer shank flexibility (Timoshenko beam) determines spectral brightness. Contact duration ≈ 2–5 ms and its dependence on velocity is the primary source of timbre change with dynamics.

**Current state:** 3 ms linear onset ramp — click prevention only, not physical.

**Note:** Full physical hammer model requires PDE solver (not RT). The practical benefit is captured by velocity-dependent spectral shape (item 2 above), which is implementable.

---

### 5. Pitch Glide at Attack

**Cited by:** RR-9516, RR-8181, Simionato 2024 — **3 of 18 papers**

**Physics:** At large amplitudes (forte), geometric nonlinearity causes `f₀` to start slightly high and fall within the first 50–200 ms as amplitude decreases.

**Implementation path:**
- Add a brief frequency modulation: `f₀ *= (1 + pitch_glide · env_total)` where `env_total` is the overall amplitude envelope at time `t`.
- `pitch_glide` would be a new `SynthConfig` parameter (small positive value, ~0.001–0.005).
- Applied only when velocity > threshold (forte only).

### 6. Weinreich Coupled-String Double Decay

**Cited by:** Piano-model-revis, Bensa 2003 — **2 of 18 papers**

**Physics:** Strings coupled via the bridge produce asymmetric double decay: fast initial decay (energy transferred to soundboard) followed by very slow decay (string re-absorbs energy). The ratio of fast/slow τ depends on bridge admittance.

**Current state:** `tau1/tau2/a1` are fit from recorded data and correctly capture the *result*, but the two τ values are symmetric per string. A Weinreich model would fit two decay rates from per-polarization measurements.

**Implementation path:** Refine `extract_params.py` to fit `tau1/tau2` from the actual double-decay visible in the EDC (Schroeder integral), rather than from power spectrum fitting.

---

### 7. Longitudinal Precursor at Bridge

**Cited by:** RR_9530 (Chabassier 2023) — **1 paper, specific to bass**

**Physics:** Longitudinal waves travel ~6× faster than transverse. For D1 (f₀ = 36 Hz), the longitudinal wave reaches the bridge ~10 ms before the transverse wave — a distinct precursor click audible in low notes.

**Implementation path:** Add a short noise burst at `noteOn` for MIDI < 50, duration ~2–10 ms scaled by string length (1/f₀).

## Recommended Next Steps

**Phase A — Low effort, high impact:**
1. ✅ `eq_gains_db` velocity interpolation — already implemented in `interpolateNoteLayers()`.
2. ✅ Pitch glide — added `pitch_glide`, `pitch_glide_tau_ms`, `pitch_glide_vel_thresh` to `SynthConfig`;
   applied as per-sample fractional frequency offset in `resonator_voice.cpp::processBlock()`.
   Default `pitch_glide=0.0` (off) — tune per instrument.
3. ✅ `n_strings` from JSON — `note_lut.cpp::parseSample()` now reads `"n_strings"` from JSON with
   fallback to hardcoded MIDI thresholds. Requires `resonators/analysis` pipeline update to emit
   the field; C++ side is ready.

**Phase B — Medium effort, high impact:**
4. Phantom partials (longitudinal) — C++ side ready:
   - `PartialParams::is_longitudinal` flag added; `is_longitudinal=true` forces `mono=true`.
   - Rendered identically to transverse partials but with `f≈2·f_k`, `τ≈τ/2`, single-string, no beating.
   - ✅ C++ render path complete. **Pending**: `resonators/analysis::extract-params.py` extension
     to detect longitudinal peaks and emit `"is_longitudinal": true` entries in `params.json`.
5. ✅ Longitudinal precursor (bass, MIDI < 50) — short high-frequency noise burst at noteOn
   for bass notes. Controlled by `SynthConfig::longitudinal_precursor` (default 0.0 = off).
   Duration auto-scaled to 2 string cycles (≈ 2/f₀), capped at 10 ms.

**Phase C — Soundboard modal transients (medium effort):**
6. Add 6–12 IIR bandpass resonators per voice (shared tuning across all notes), excited by
   impulse at noteOn, decay τ ≈ 50–300 ms. Captures "body" at attack onset.
   Parameters could be globally fixed or extracted from low-frequency EQ residuals.

**Phase D — Architecture / training:**
7. Reparametrize `tau1/tau2` as physical `b1/b3` coefficients for DDSP training and latent
   space interpolation (Simionato 2024 model).
8. For latent space: model instrument interpolation via soundboard mobility proxy, not raw
   param vectors (MAESSTRO recommendation).
